# Vanillify-IPS-Generator

Check releases if you just want the IPS file.

This program generates an IPS patch to apply to a generated SMZ3 rando.

This patch performs the following functions:
  All item locations contain their vanilla item
  Dungeon prizes are all vanilla
  Medallion locks (TR/Mire) are vanilla

Submit an issue if there's a problem or something. I won't pay attention to this otherwise.
